#
# docker image for this repository's objective of building the mediapipe hands solution (build target) from scratch, specifically in a Ubuntu 24.04 container.
# it includes a step readying it to serve as a container for running a github self-hosted runner that can execute workflows
# for github copilot, since the github cloud environment gives copilot an impossibly hard time in network restrictions
# and configuration which is prohibitive to working with a complex bazel build that needs to pull a lot of dependencies
# from the internet.
#
# so you can use this image as such a container for a self-hosted github workflows runner for developing that building to work,
# or just as one that can build mediapipe from source (when that goal will have been accoplished).
